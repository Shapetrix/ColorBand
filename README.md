# Color Band Design Document

## Game Identity / Mantra: 
Very Colorful, Match Game, that you work against the time to collect the magical stars, that will help you to unlock, new and wonderful worlds. 

## Design Pillars:
- Accomplishment: the feeling you get when you beat the clock and get stars to unlock the next level
- Strategy: figuring out the best moves to make to get the largest color combo and setting yourself up for the next move.  
- Fast paced: trying to get the most points before time runs out. 

## Genre/Mechanics Summary:

### Genre

Game Play all the blocks feel the screen, once the blocks have falling the player will swipe rows or columns to create single color line, once the play creates the line it will collapse and new blocks will fill the empty space.

### Mechanics:

#### Clock:
- The clock is used to keep time of how long the play has to play the level.
#### Scoring:
- Scoring is based on the collection of blocks collected in a chain.
- If player matches 3 of the same color blocks in a chain, he or she is rewarded with set value of points those points are added to the score.
- if player matches 7 or more then he or she is rewared with bouns points for completeing a more advance chain. 

#### Worlds:
- Worlds are unlocked with progression or bought thro in-game currency "Stars"

#### Levels:
- Levels are where the player will collect points and stars to unlock worlds, or buy new worlds with the stairs they earned.

### Features: 

#### POSSIBLE POWER UPS:
- Block swap: So you can switch blocks for stars or to get more colors in the combination. one time use.
- Color Flood: Change the whole board to the same color. 
- Score Doubler: Doubles the score for your combo
- Colorizer: Turns grey blocks to color.
- Time Power Up: Use leftover time from when you beat the level to fill up a “Time bonus” bar and when it’s full you can use it as a power up to add time to your game clock in the level of your choice. 

#### PROGRESSION:
- Introduce the Grey Blocks, these can still move with rows and columns but can’t be part of the color chain. When you start to introduce the grey blocks, it is a set number of blocks but in the higher levels, as the time counts down, more grey blocks are added.
- Time gets shorter, the higher the level the player is the less time they have to collect points. 
- Stars, stars will appear in each level based on the score the player gets. So once a player reaches a certain score, the first star will appear when the player reaches the second and third marks the second and third stars will appear. 
- Using Stars, When the player selects a world to play it they are giving 10 levels to complete in the world, in the levels they can collect 3 stars per level, once the player collects these they can use them to unlock higher worlds.

- Player input would be touching the screen to swipe left right up or down to move columns and rows
